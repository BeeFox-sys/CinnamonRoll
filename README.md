# rpBot

This is a discord bot for roleplay. Inspired by [Pluralkit](https://github.com/xSke/PluralKit)!

# How to run!
The bot currently isn't hosted, however I plan to do this once more features are added!

1. Download the git
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Create `config.json` in the `bot` directory (see `sample-config.json` for the layout), and set bot token
4. Run a mongo database on localhost (or point to another location in config)
5. Run `node bot/main.js` from the top of the directory to run the bot

# Dependencies
* `discord.js` 11.5.0 and up
* `mongoose` 5.5.8 and up
