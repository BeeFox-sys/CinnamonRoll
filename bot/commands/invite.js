    Give the bot permissions integer '536996928' which allows the following permissions:

    Manage webhooks - so the bot can make [NPC] posts
    View channels - so the bot can read text channels (and see voice channels) throughout the server
    Send messages - so the bot can send messages throughout the server
    Manage messages - e.g. for deleting OP's commands
    Embed links - e.g. to post links in [NPC] posts
    Attach files - let it send files and images too
    Read messages history - might need this later on for message lookup/context-aware stuff
    Add reactions - let the bot react to messages e.g. for controlling embed panels
