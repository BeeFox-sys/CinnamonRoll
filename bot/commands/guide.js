`Now that we have a character, you'll notice that there is a string of five letters.
These letters are the characters id, and each and every character has a completly uneiqe one!
Try running the commands \`${guildSettings.prefix}character <name>\` and \`${guildSettings.prefix}character <id>\` where \`<name>\` is your characters name (if it is longer then one word, put \`"\` around) and where \`<id>\` is the id you were just given!
Fun fact! There are 11,881,376 diffrent possible ids!`

`Wow, That looks pretty empty. Why don't we add some stuff!
When editing a character, all your commands will start with \`${guildSettings.prefix}character <name>\` or \`${guildSettings.prefix}character <id>\`. But for simplicity's sake, and because ids will always work, we will be using \`${guildSettings.prefix}character <id>\` in this guide.
There are many things you can set for your character! You can set your characters, nickname, birthday, pronouns, avatar, colour, and description!
Feel free to try them out! An example command is \`${guildSettings.prefix}character <id> description This is an awsome character!\``

`And thats everything!
If you still need some help you can [head to the support server](https://discord.gg/PrKWQP2), or you could use \`${guildSettings.prefix}help character\` for a quick refresher of all the commands and how they work!
Thanks for sticking with me through all that! I hope you have a nice time playing and an amazing day!
You can press ‚ùå to end the guide, ‚óÄ to go back and navagate through the pages, or if you leave it be the guide will end in 10 minutes.
Have a great day!`

You can choose what to type before and after your message to!
\`Character:text\` will make it so if you type Character: at the start of a message, it will be proxied!
\`text-Character\` will do the same, but with -Character at the end of your message
\`text\` or leaving it blank will disable proxying
And you can customise it all you like! by just changing what is in front of, and after, \`text\` in the proxy command`
